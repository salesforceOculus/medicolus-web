{"name":"Medicolus-web","tagline":"","body":"![MedOculus Logo](http://i.imgur.com/O7JMIVX.jpg)\r\n##What is MedOculus?##\r\n**MedOculus** uses several cutting-edge technologies to improve healthcare for surgeons, dentist and other doctors.\r\nDoctors will be able to see, in real time, patient details, medical scans (e.g. MRI) and other data useful during the operations.\r\n\r\n##Augmented Operation Room##\r\nThis technology allows to extend the capabilities of any Operation Room (OR) with augmented reality.\r\nAugmented information will be shown to the doctor whenever needed, thus improving their efficiency.\r\n\r\n##Portable Scans##\r\n**MedOculus** can also be employed during consultations with the patient for discussing the results of the analysis. The 3D visualization will dramatically improve the communication between the doctor and the patient.\r\nThe patients can install the software on their laptop to be able to look at their scans while being at home. The scan markers are printable and easily transportable.\r\n\r\n##Cradle of Technologies##\r\nHere is the list of devices that compose the **MedOculus**:\r\n- **Oculus Rift**: Virtual Reality headset\r\n- **Leap Motion**: Sensor device that supports hand and finger motions as input\r\n- **2x HD Cameras** (only 1 used in the prototype, due to lack of resources)\r\n- **Moto 360**: Android smart watch\r\n\r\nThe following technologies have been used:\r\n- **Salesforce**: Apps for management of patient's data.\r\n- **Salesforce1**: Patient's data dynamically stored and retrieved from the platform.\r\n- **OpenCV**: Image processing in real-time.\r\n- **ArUco**: Markers for augmented reality.\r\n- **OGRE**: Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine for the augmented reality.\r\n\r\n##MedOculus in Action##\r\nHere are some screenshots of the working prototype:\r\n![MedOculus-hand](http://i.imgur.com/o2KjlGl.png =250x)\r\n![MedOculus-skull](http://i.imgur.com/gdTLWby.png =250x)\r\n\r\nA demo video is available at the bottom of this page.\r\n\r\n##Future Plans##\r\n**MedOculus** is created as a proof of concept to demonstrate the possibility of such a technology.\r\nSince this project was developed with usability in mind, the prototype is already fully functioning.\r\n\r\n> More work and, possibly, some investments would push the project even further, improving and adding its capabilities for real uses.\r\n\r\n##Notes##\r\nThanks to **Salesforce**, **Accenture**, **BeMyApp** and **Ahoy Berlin** for the event and the opportunity.\r\nProject created for the hackathon \"Hack and Wear\", Berlin 2015.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
